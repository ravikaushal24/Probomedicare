    </div>
      <br>
			<p class="P">When the COVID-19 pandemic upended daily life in the India, our founding doctors had a dilemma. We wanted to continue 
			to offer our services to our patients without putting their health at risk. As a result, in March 2020, our telemedicine company 
			E-HealthCare was launched. At the launch of our company, we had only a few customers and five doctors. Since then, we have been gaining 
			many customers and have even employed many medical proffesionals from various fields to work for our company as well. We have expanded 
			our company to provide services to other countries and have quickly been reaching new milestones. We strive to make our website as 
			streamlined as possible for our users, so we hope that your experience with us goes smoothly. </p>
			<!--The 5 Founding Doctors, includes graduation information, specialization, what they should be consulted for, the section that they direct, years of experience, a fun fact, why they joined us, and maybe something about their passion for medicine.-->
